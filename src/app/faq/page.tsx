        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">What are Adopt Me fonts?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Adopt Me fonts are Unicode characters that create styled text effects. They&rsquo;re not actual fonts, but special characters that look like bold, 
          italic, bubble, or decorative text. When you paste them into Roblox Adopt Me, they display as styled text in your name or chat. 
          These characters are part of the Unicode standard and are supported by Roblox&rsquo;s text rendering system.

          To change your Roblox player name with adopt me fonts: (1) Generate your styled text using our tool above, (2) Copy the result, 
          (3) Go to Roblox Settings → Profile → Display Name, (4) Paste your styled name and save. Your new name will appear in Adopt Me and all Roblox games.

        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">Can I use adopt me fonts for pet names?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Yes! Adopt me fonts work great for pet names. In Adopt Me, select your pet, click the name tag icon, and paste your styled name. 
          Keep pet names under 20 characters for best results. Bubble and cute fonts are especially popular for pets.

        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">Will Roblox filter these characters?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Roblox may filter some adopt me fonts characters, especially if you use too many decorative symbols or very long names. 
          To avoid filtering: keep names short (under 20 characters), use simpler styles like Bold or Bubble, and avoid combining multiple decorative fonts. 
          If a name gets rejected, try a shorter version or a different style.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">Which adopt me fonts are most compatible?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          The most compatible adopt me fonts are: <strong>Bold</strong> (excellent readability), <strong>Bubble</strong> (very popular, high compatibility), 
          <strong>Small Caps</strong> (clean and reliable), and <strong>Double Struck</strong> (works well across devices). 
          Decorative styles with combining marks (like Underline) may have lower compatibility.

        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">Why does my name look different on mobile?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Different devices render Unicode characters differently. Some adopt me fonts may appear as question marks or boxes on older devices. 
          Test your name on the device you&rsquo;ll primarily use. Bubble and Bold fonts have the best cross-device compatibility.

        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">Are adopt me fonts safe to use?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Yes, adopt me fonts are completely safe. They use standard Unicode characters that Roblox officially supports. 
          There&rsquo;s no risk of getting banned. However, if Roblox filters your name, it simply won&rsquo;t be accepted - you can try a different style.

      <section className="mt-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">Can I use adopt me fonts in chat?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Yes, but with limitations. You can paste styled text into chat, but Roblox&rsquo;s chat filter is stricter than name filters. 
          Some decorative characters may be replaced with asterisks or filtered out entirely. Simple styles like Bold work best in chat.

        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">How do I combine fonts with emojis?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Use our <a href="/names" className="underline text-pink-600">name generator</a> to create names with emojis and fonts together. 
          You can also manually add emojis before or after your styled text. Popular combinations include hearts, stars, and animal emojis with bubble or cute fonts.
        </p>

      <section className="mt-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold">My name shows as question marks - what&rsquo;s wrong?</h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-zinc-700">
          Question marks (???) usually mean your device doesn&rsquo;t support those Unicode characters. Try using more common adopt me fonts like Bold, 
          Bubble, or Small Caps. These have the widest device support and should display correctly on all platforms.
